Raw data and DE data has not been available because it was not published by experimental collaborators. 

Preprocessing and DE folders contain scripts for miRNA and mRNA data. 

Data for TimiRGeN has been made available and a script for this can be found in the corresponding folder. 

Some TimiRGeN output is available in the pathvisio file. This is used to create dynamic signalling pathways.
